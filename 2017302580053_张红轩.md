BGP routers use the AS-PATH attribute to detect and prevent looping advertisements. Specifically, if a router sees that its own AS is contained in the path list, it will reject the advertisement, so the loop would not happen.

It is not always the shortest as path.  There are many factors that can effect the choice of the Route-selection. Our textbook introduced some "elimination rule", such as according to the local preference. And some business factor should be considered. One ISP may not want to take unnecessary data flow, so they may not to advertise some routes they know.

a. Router 3c learns about prefix x from 4c, so the used routing protocol should be eBGP.

b. Router 3a learns about prefix x from 3b, so the used routing protocol should be iBGP

c. Router 1c learns about prefix x from 3a, so the used routing protocol should be eBGP

d. Router 1d learns about prefix x from 1a, so the used routing protocol should be iBGP

a. I<sub>1</sub>, because 1d would learn about prefix x from 1a first.

b. I<sub>2</sub> Both routes have the same AS-PATH length, but I2 begins to have the path of the nearest next-hop router

c.  I<sub>1</sub>, because it starts with the shortest AS-PATH path.
