Recall that there are many issues to be considered in the route selection process. It is very likely that a longer loop-free path is preferred over a shorter loop-free path due to economic reason. For example, an AS might prefer to send traffic to one neighbor instead of another neighbor with shorter AS distance.**P14**a) eBGP  b) iBGP  c) eBGP  d) iBGP**P16** One way for C to force B to hand over all of B’s traffic to D on the east coast is for C to only advertise its route to D via its east coast peering point with C.**P22**Often, the time when network management is most needed is in times of stress, when the network may be severely congested and packets are being lost.  With SNMP running over TCP, TCP's congestion control would cause SNMP to back-off and stop sending messages at precisely the time when the network manager needs to send SNMP messages.
